The main function which distributes various tasks to other functions. 

Expects a csv file ./input/input.csv which contains the sensor readings. Calls the functions that perform the algorithm iteratively for each time stamp in the input file and then produces an output file ./output/results.txt containing the fused value for each time stamp and a list of faulty sensors.
